  <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>We may partner with third-party ad networks and analytics providers (such as Google AdMob or Google Analytics) to serve advertisements and analyze how users interact with the Game. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies to collect information about your device and how you use the Game.</p>
  <p>You can choose to limit personalized advertising through your device’s privacy settings or by following the instructions provided by your ad network. However, please note that limiting personalized ads may reduce the relevance of the advertisements you see.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third-party vendors who provide services on our behalf, such as hosting, analytics, or customer support.</li>

    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or for a period required by law. Once we no longer need the information, we take reasonable steps to securely destroy or de-identify it.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no security practice is 100% foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
